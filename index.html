        Natalia Kukula is a newbie web developer. She is aquainted with HTML and started crawling in CSS. Soon enough Java Script
        will be under her belt.

        Early on in life, Natalia Kukula got familiar with the vast customer service industry that led her to a career in hospitality.
        Therefore her soft skills are mastered to a "T". Now, she is on a new journey in the pursuit of technical abilities.
        She has an undergraduate degree in English and has had her share of experience with teaching (EFL and ESL). Her master's
        degree is in Journalism, and she majored in Media Marketing and Pulic Relations. Her first full time job was at a
        publishing company. As she likes to say, "She was making a little cash from people turning into ash" because she
        worked for the obituary department at the Chicago Tribune.

        Natalia is originally from Poland, where she lived most of her life. Her dad lives in Chicago and her mom in Warsaw. Another
        reason why she ended up working in hospitality is her passion for travel. As a student she would work in hostels,
        which would allow her to stay for free all around Europe. As a globetrotter, she says she is passionate about "pretty
        things" and people, therefore her ultimate goal is to mash her creative and entrepreneurial side with her love for
        human-centered design.
